👨‍💻 About Me
I am a dedicated IT Support Specialist with a passion for technology, coming from a background in academic administration and database administration. My foundation in data science gives me a unique analytical approach, allowing me to spot patterns in system issues and prioritize automation for solving complex IT challenges.

After enrolling in the Generation IT Support with Cybersecurity bootcamp, I sharpened my skills in hardware, networking, and customer support. I thrive on challenges, which drove me to earn the Google IT Support Professional certificate during the bootcamp and the CompTIA A+ certificate just one week after graduating. I am eager to apply my skills to deliver exceptional user support in any IT environment.
